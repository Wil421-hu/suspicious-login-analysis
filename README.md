## Project Overview
This project demonstrates **cybersecurity incident analysis** using **SQL**, **RMarkdown**, and **Tableau** to investigate suspicious login attempts from an attack actor.  
The workflow focuses on **geolocation mismatch detection** â€” identifying login events where the country of access does not match the employee's office location.

## Objectives
- Detect **suspicious login attempts** based on location mismatch.
- Count **failed logins** by country to spot unusual access patterns.
- Visualize login trends with **Tableau dashboards**.
- Demonstrate integration of SQL queries with RMarkdown for reporting.

## Project Structure
- Project_cybersecurity_Demo.Rmd # Main RMarkdown analysis file
- output_report.pdf # Final PDF report (generated from RMarkdown)
- /images # Supporting visuals and screenshots
- README.md # Project documentation

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** â€” Data querying and conditional logic for location mismatch detection.
- **RMarkdown** â€” Reproducible analysis & PDF/HTML reporting.
- **Tableau** â€” Interactive visualizations & dashboards.
- **GitHub** â€” Version control and project sharing.

## Key Insights
- Login attempts from **unexpected countries** were flagged for review.
- Certain regions showed **multiple failed logins**, suggesting targeted access attempts.
- Visual trends helped pinpoint **time-based spikes** in suspicious activity.
